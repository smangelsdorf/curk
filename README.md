# curk

A Clojure IRC server.

This is a toy project I don't intend to maintain, written only to learn
the language.

## Usage

I've been running it in the REPL while doing development.

    $ lein repl
      ...
    curk.core=> (start)
    #<server$start_server$fn__10746 aleph.netty.server$start_server$fn__10746@653f3173>
    curk.core=>
